## What is Markdown? 8 :)__  Page Link : [What is Markdown?](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. 
Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

**Using Markdown** is different than using a **WYSIWYG** editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. :)__

**For example**, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it ```(e.g., # Heading One)```. 
Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it ```(e.g., **this text is bold**)```. 
It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to **_WYSIWYG_** applications. 
The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor. 
You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. 
Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. 
There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.

**Depending** on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that’s okay. 
According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered. :)__
